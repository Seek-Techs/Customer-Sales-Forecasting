## Customer Sales Forecasting Using Time Series Techniques
This project explores customer sales forecasting for a retail store chain using time series analysis and machine learning techniques.

# Project Goal
The objective is to develop a model that predicts future monthly customer sales based on historical sales data. This can be valuable for inventory management, resource allocation, and business planning.

# Data and Preprocessing
The project utilizes historical sales data stored in a CSV file (train.csv). The data undergoes several preprocessing steps:

Cleaning: Addressing missing values and irrelevant columns
Date Transformation: Converting dates into a format suitable for time series analysis
Aggregation: Grouping sales data by month to capture monthly sales trends
Stationarization: Differencing consecutive monthly sales to achieve stationarity for modeling
Feature Engineering: Creating lagged features representing sales from previous months
Methodology
Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the CSV data and handle missing values, irrelevant columns.
Data Preprocessing: Transform dates, aggregate by month, and calculate differences for stationarity.
Feature Engineering: Create lagged features to capture the influence of past sales.
Splitting Data: Divide the data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
Model Selection and Training: Train a linear regression model to predict future sales based on historical data.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 score.
Visualization: Create visualizations comparing actual and predicted sales to assess model accuracy.
# Results
The linear regression model provides a baseline for forecasting.
The model's performance can be further improved by exploring more advanced models and incorporating additional factors.
Future Work
Experimentation with time series models like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) to capture complex patterns.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Feature engineering with trend and seasonality.
Inclusion of external factors like holidays or promotions.
Implementation of cross-validation for robust model evaluation.
